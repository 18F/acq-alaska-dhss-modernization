# Welcome!
This repo contains documentation describing the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) modernization project. It is intended to be a place where project participants can keep track of the overall project goals, the decision framework, progress to date and learnings as we work. It is also intended to be a project 'home page' where members can access important and up-to-date project information that exists somewhere else.

## Our Big Goal
We seek to transform practices around technology, product and procurement in the Alaska DHSS _so that_ it can more successfully administer the various benefit programs (Medicaid, Foodstamps (SNAP), Temporary assistance (TANF) etc.) for which it is responsible.

## The Challenge
The challenge is rooted in the need for Alaska to migrate these programs off of their "old legacy" eligibilty system, EIS, to something that costs less to operate and is more flexible to change. The EIS system works well for what it does, but it is built in a old technology (COBOL on a mainframe) and is not easy to change. It is also expensive to operate, and as other agencies in Alaska migrate away from the system, DHSS will be responsible for more and more of this cost. Further, expertise for this type of technology is aging out, so it will be harder and harder to support it going forward.

To this end, Alaska entered into an agreement with a contractor to migrate all programs to a bespoke system that was supposed to be more automated, flexible and maintainable. The first phase of this migration did not go well, leaving the State with a "new legacy" Medicaid eligibility system, ARIES, that does not work. And, the contractor walked away from the agreement in December of 2016, leaving the State with virtually no ability to iterate on the system and barely any ability to maintain/fix it.

ARIES has arguably caused a _significant decrease in worker productivity_ as evidenced by a backlog of between 16,000 and 24,000 applications for Medicaid and other public assistance programs (the exact number is unknown due to bad data and duplication), and a documented decrease in application processing per worker per day from 12 to 4. Beneficiaries can wait months to receive benefits and workers are frustrated. Clients get frustrated with delays, and this causes them to enter duplicate applications into the system thereby adding to the backlog and pressure. 

## Our Hypothesis
We want to move away from a legacy "Big Bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product development, and DevOps practices. We believe doing this will incrementally improve the current situation in a measurable and sustainable way, and eventually allow the continued migration of programs away from the EIS system and onto something more modern, flexible and maintainable.

We will know we are successful, if we can increase worker productivity and morale, among other things, and if benefits are being provided in a timely manner to those who are eligible. We are currently focused on getting a win here fairly soon so that we can show State workers and the Legislature that we are moving in the right direction.

## Near-term Milestones
1. Identify product owner and team - Done 2/28/17
2. Identify where to start - Done 3/2/17 (Search API and UI to support)
3. Validate starting point - Doing
4. Acquire a vendor - To Do
5. First acquisition - To Do
