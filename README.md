# Project Description
We seek to transform practices around technology, product and procurement in the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services _so that_ the department can more easily administer the various eligibility programs (MMIS, SNAP, TANF etc.) for which they are responsible.

Alaskaâ€™s contractor has decided to walk away from their contract, leaving the state with a "new legacy" Medicaid eligibility system that is not well understood, is difficult to maintain and build upon, and has directly caused a _significant decrease_ in worker productivity and morale. Alaska is _still_ faced with the task of migrating all other eligibility programs away from the "old legacy" COBOL system because the old system is expensive and difficult to change, making it harder to adapt to real world changes in eligibility requirements. 

The Alaska team is currently trying to cope with this difficult situation. We are hoping to move them from a legacy "Big Bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product development, and DevOps practices. We expect this approach to incrementally improve their current situation and improve outcomes in general for the department going forward.
