# Project Description
This project seeks to transform the internal technology and product practices as well as the procurement process in the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services so that the department can more easily manage the various eligibility programs (MMIS, SNAP, TANF etc.) they are responsible for administrating.

The Alaska team is currently trying to cope with a fairly difficult situation, with Medicaid eligibility in particular, caused by their last attempt at acquiring software through the legacy process. We are hoping to move them from a legacy "Big Bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product development, and DevOps practices. We expect this approach to incrementally improve their current situation and improve outcomes in general for the department going forward.
