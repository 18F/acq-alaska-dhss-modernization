# Project Description
We seek to transform practices around technology, product and procurement in the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services _so that_ the department can more successfullt administer the various eligibility programs (MMIS, SNAP, TANF etc.) for which they are responsible.


# The Problem
The problem is rooted in the need for Alaska to migrate these programs off of their "old legacy" eligibilty system, EIS, to something that costs less to operate and is more flexible to change. The EIS system works well for what it does, but it is built in legacy COBOL technology and is not easy to change. It is also expensive to operate, and as other agencies in Alaska migrate away from the system, DHSS will be left carring more and more of this cost. Further, expertise for this type of platform is aging out so it will be harder and harder to support it going forward.

In service of this need, Alaska entered into an agreement with a contractor to migrate all programs to a bespoke system that was supposed to be more automated, flexible and maintainable. The first phase of this migration did not go well,leaving the State with a "new legacy" Medicaid eligibility system, ARIES, that does not work. And, the contractor walked away from the agreement in December of 2016, leaving the State virtually no ability to iterate on the system and barely any ability to maintain it.

The new system has arguably also caused a _significant decrease_ in worker productivity evidenced a backlog of between 16,000 and 24,000 applications for Medicaid and other public assistance programs (the exact number is unknown due to bad data and duplication), and a documented decrease in application processing per worker per day from 12 to 4. Beneficiaries can wait months to receive benefits and workers are frustrated. Clients get frustrated with delays and this causes them to enter duplicate applications into the system thereby adding to the backlog and pressure. In spite of these issues, Alaska continues to maintain and use the ARIES system to process MAGI applications. 

Alaska _is also still_ faced with the task of migrating all other eligibility programs away from EIS.


# Our Hypothesis
Our goal is to help them move away from a legacy "Big Bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product development, and DevOps practices. We want to do this because we believe this approach will incrementally improve their current situation and allow them to continue migrating programs away from their EIS system and on to something more modern, flexible and maintainable. This will then allow the State of Alaska to provide benefits to eligible clients in a timely manner and without error.

We will know we are successful, if what we help the State procure increases worker productivity and morale, among other things, and if benefits are being provided in a timely manner to those who are eligible. We are currently focused on getting a win in this direction fairly soon that the State can show its workers and the Legislature that they are moving in the right direction.
