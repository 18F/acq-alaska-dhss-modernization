EIS Replacement Project

Vendor Onboarding Checklist

# Introduction

## Purpose

This document supports the Division of Public Assistance Eligibility
Information System Replacement (EIS-R) Project. Specifically, this
document addresses our agile acquisition practice and onboarding new
vendor staff. Within agile acquisition, we anticipate bringing in a
potentially different vendor every three to four months, possibly more
often when we begin running multiple acquisitions simultaneously. With
short timelines, this onboarding checklist will bring new vendor staff
up to speed as quickly as possible.

## Document maintenance

This document contains a revision history log. When changes occur, the
owner of the new version will update the version to the next increment,
identify the publish date of the version and summarize the changes in a
comment.

## Project centralized document repository

When related or supporting documents that are referenced within this
document, these are listed in Appendix A of this document. The project
maintains a centralized repository of documents that are versioned in
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and published to the DHSS IT project
SharePoint site.

# Audience

This document intends to inform EIS-R State of Alaska project staff and
the vendors we engage with in various product-increment acquisitions.
