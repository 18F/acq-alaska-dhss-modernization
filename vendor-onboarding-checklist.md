# Vendor onboarding checklist

## Purpose

This document supports the Division of Public Assistance Eligibility
Information System Replacement (EIS-R) Project. Specifically, this
document addresses our agile acquisition practice and onboarding new
vendor staff. Within agile acquisition, we anticipate bringing in a
potentially different vendor every three to four months, possibly more
often when we begin running multiple acquisitions simultaneously. With
short timelines, this onboarding checklist will bring new vendor staff
up to speed as quickly as possible.

# Audience

This document intends to inform EIS-R State of Alaska project staff and
the vendors we engage with in various product-increment acquisitions.

# Roles

engaged with the
