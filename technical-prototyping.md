## Technical Prototyping
In working with legacy systems, it's especially important to test technical assumptions *before* scoping any kind of procurement, because there are likely unknown hazards that could put your procurement at risk, and these hazards can't be known unless you start building something.

Unlike most kinds of prototypes, technical prototypes are not focused on user experience, but rather on the mechanics behind the user's experience. They test things like "Can we really access the data we think we need?", or "How does this external API actually work?"—so they’re pretty bare-bones. They show *just enough* of the user-facing functionality to verify some kind of technical implementation. Practically, the prototype follows some user on a "happy path" user flow through that implementation.

Prototyping a small end-to-end user flow is something that teams can do quickly before writing an RFP, and should help identify any hazards in the code, the deployment process or any other technical aspect of a project. This will help teams properly scope the procurement and build out a reasonable RFP with some useful documentation for buyers and for vendors.

## The Alaska DHSS Modernization Project
Throughout this project we will be using technical prototyping whenever we are faced some question about integration with existing systems, the nature of existing data sources, or any other existing technical process that we plan to leverage as part of our planned acquisition. We may change direction at times, based on what we learn through prototyping. We may decide to pursue a completely different implementation, or even a different set of features entirely. Best case is that we can proceed with the original plan, only now with much more information that will help ensure the success of the acquisition.
